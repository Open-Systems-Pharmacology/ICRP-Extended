# ICRP-Extended
On going work regarding ICRP Population improvement based on [this](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Forum/issues/87)  discussion in the forum

## How to use the database

* Close PK-Sim
* Goto folder  `C:\ProgramData\Open Systems Pharmacology\PK-Sim\7.2`
* Create a copy of the PKSimDB.mdb file (so that you can revert at any time to the installation version of the model database)
* Copy the file `PKSimDB.mdb` from this repository into folder `C:\ProgramData\Open Systems Pharmacology\PK-Sim\7.2`
* Restart PK-Sim. You should have a ICRP Extended Population available


The list of all age dependent parameters for the ICRP Population can also be found in ICRP Parameters.xlsx
